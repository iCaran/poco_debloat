# "Xiaomi SIM Activation Service
# SIM authentication process to access exclusive features in certain MIUI applications.
# For the activation to work you need to send a international SMS to China.
# Your carrier may block this by default and/or you'll probably need to pay extra for this.
# After SIM activation, you can send text messages (Mi Messages) to other Mi users using internet connection (like i-messages).
# You will be able to synchronize you messages into Mi Cloud 
# and this also enables the Mi Find Device feature which allows you to track your phoneâ€™s location from your online Mi account.
# Note: To enable/disable Mi Messages go to Settings -> System Apps -> Messaging and reboot",

# There's also a Fused Location Provider embeded in 'com.google.android.gms'
# This Xiaomi location provider obviously has as much tracking as the Google one 
# but if you can remove one tracking source it's better than nothing.
